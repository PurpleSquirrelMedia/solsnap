# SolSnap

### Overview:

SolSnap is a Solana Saga mobile application for Android devices that allows users to seamlessly take images or videos with their mobile phone camera, mint NFTs of the media, and then list the new NFTs to on-chain marketplaces, in one app, and in one fluid motion.

### Why would I want this?

If I'm an active social media content creator, my monitization options are limited to the web2 platforms that host my accounts.  They receive traffic and benefit from all of the media I post, and in return, maybe pay me a small reward for bringing the users to their platform.  What if an image that I posted is worth more than just some likes, shares, or comments?  What if someone wants to own that image, and I am happy to sell it to them?

We can all think of popular, single social media posts that went viral.  How is this content valued?  Likes and retweets?  What if you could buy a short TikTok clip as soon as it was posted, maybe because you loved it, or maybe because you thought it would go viral, and you wanted to snag it before it did?

Examples of social media posts valued as NFTs: Jack Dorsey's first Tweet, NBA Top Shot, and likely many more to come.

### Why hasn't anyone made this yet?

Because most social media is generated, posted, and consumed on mobile devices.  Blockchain has not been made easily accessible on mobile devices - yet.

### Features

Users will have the option to:
* list media from their photo gallery or create new media with their camera.
* mint 1 or more NFTs to either their wallet, or their wallet(s) of choice.
* list NFTs on one or more on-chain marketplaces for purchase.
* share that same media on existing social media platforms(Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc.).
  * include a link to the NFT marketplace listing in the social media post.
* beyond image and video media, text will also be able to be seamlessly minted as an NFT.
